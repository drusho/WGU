## D214: MS Data Analysis Capstone

### Course Summary
The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone is a capstone course that challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domasters into one project. The project is designed to demonstrate students' ability to apply their academic and professional abilities to solve a real-world problem.

The project can be in the form of a research paper and/or a presentation. Students must work independently to gather data, conduct analysis, and develop a solution. They must also present their findings to a panel of experts.

### Objectives

- Professional Readiness: Integration of competencies from across the degree program, demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute to the chosen professional field.

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has three assessments. Each assessment contains a written report and/or the Python code within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

#### Task 1
This project required the student to develop a proposal for a topic for their capstone project. This begins with defining their intended research question as well as null and alternative hypotheses. The context of the research must be explained, and methods justified.  There were several topics that have been retired due to excessive coverage by previous alumni. 

For my capstone, I proposed a topic utilizing data published from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository called [Online Shopper’s Purchasing Intention](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset). 

The written approval form can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/D214Task1.pdf). 

#### Task 2
This task requires the student to perform their capstone research topic and create a report outlining the various steps of this process. This includes the research question, the data collection and preparation processes, the analysis addressing the research question, and a summary of the outcome of the analysis, including limitations, recommendations, and additional opportunities for supplemental research.

My research question for this project was *”What attributes within the captured Google Analytics metrics can contribute to the possibility of a customer purchasing an item?”* The null and alternative hypotheses were as follows:

* **Hypothesis: Null hypothesis**-. The logistic regression model shows that the predictor variable of “Revenue” and the explanatory variables do not have a statistically significant relationship.
* **Alternate Hypothesis**-The logistic regression model shows a statistically significant relationship between the predictor variable “Revenue” and explanatory variables.
  
The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/D214Task2.pdf) and the Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/AFCodeD214.ipynb).


My project earned an Excellence Award from WGU. The evaluator for this project submitted my work for the award and made the following observations: *“The submission offers a comprehensive review of the research question and analysis of the data related to attributes and customer purchases. The work artfully describes the use of the Logistic Regression model and provides relevant interpretations and visualizations of the results. The work carefully responds to the rubric requirements with minimal grammatical disruption.”*, You can see my award [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/Excellence_Award.pdf).

#### Task 3

This task requires the student to develop an executive summary and Powerpoint presentation of their capstone project from Task 2. This executive summary provides a brief overview of the capstone project that was completed in Task 2. The following sections provide an overview of the study problem and hypothesis, the data analysis process, the study findings, the study limitations, the recommended actions, and the expected corporate benefits.

The executive summary can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/D214Task3.pdf) and the PowerPoint Presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D214/AFisherD214Task3PPT.pptx).
