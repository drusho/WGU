## D211: Advanced Data Acquisition with PostgreSQL and Tableau

### Course Summary

This course teaches students how to use advanced SQL skills to further the data analytics lifecycle. Students will learn how to:

- Use JOINs to combine data from multiple tables
- Use aggregations to summarize data
- Acquire data from various sources, including relational databases.
- Use SQL to support core organizational needs

### Objectives

- Advanced SQL, Joins, Unions: Application of advanced SQL operations to integrate data sources.
- Data Sourcing: Exploration of data acquisition. 

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has one assessment in the form of a written report along with an interactive Tableau Dashboard.

The project was virtually the same as the previous D210 projects, excluding how the data sources are integrated within the dashboard. The same two datasets utilized within this project were the WGU-provided telecommunication dataset as well as an external dataset, the [IBM telco](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telcocustomer-
churn-ibm-dataset?resource=download) dataset retrieved from Kaggle.  

PostgreSQL pgAdmin environment was used to provide data cleaning and exploration processes before directly importing into Tableau via Connect with Server.
The project writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D211/D211Task1.pdf) and the Tableau dashboard can be found on my Tableau Public page under the name, [WGUvsIBM-D211Dashboard]( https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexa.fisher/viz/WGUvsIBM-211Dashboard/WGUvsIBM)
