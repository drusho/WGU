## Part I: Research Question

A.  Describe one question or decision that could be addressed using the data set you chose. The summarized question or decision must be relevant to a realistic organizational need or situation.
The dataset that was chosen for this assignment was "medical_raw_data.csv." This dataset comes from a hospital chain and includes information on patients' conditions, demographics, and treatments. The dataset does not include the original reason for hospitalization.  

One question that could be addressed using this dataset is to determine what factors that patient with high rates of readmission have in common.

B.  Describe all variables in the data set (regardless of the research question) and indicate the data type for each variable. Use examples from the data set to support your claims.

## Part II: Data-Cleaning Plan

_Note: You may use Python or R for implementing your coding solutions, manipulating the data, and creating visual representations._

C.  Explain the plan for cleaning the data by doing the following:

1. Propose a plan that includes the relevant techniques and specific steps needed to assess the quality of the data in the data set.

2. Justify your approach for assessing the quality of the data, including the following:

   - characteristics of the data being assessed
   - the approach used to assess the quality of the data

3. Justify your selected programming language and any libraries and packages that will support the data-cleaning process.

4. Provide the annotated code you will use to assess the quality of the data in an executable script file.

## Part III: Data Cleaning

D.  Summarize the data-cleaning process by doing the following:

1. Describe the findings for the data quality issues found from the implementation of the data-cleaning plan from part C.

2. Justify your methods for mitigating the data quality issues in the data set.

3. Summarize the outcome from the implementation of each data-cleaning step.

4. Provide the annotated code you will use to mitigate the data quality issues—including anomalies—in the data set in an executable script file.

5. Provide a copy of the cleaned data set as a CSV file.

6. Summarize the limitations of the data-cleaning process.

7. Discuss how the limitations summarized in part D6 could affect the analysis of the question or decision from part A.

E.  Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the significant features of the data set by doing the following:

1. Identify the total number of principal components and provide the output of the principal components loading matrix.

2. Justify the reduced number of the principal components and include a screenshot of a scree plot.

3. Describe how the organization would benefit from the use of PCA.

## Part IV. Supporting Documents

F.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes the presenter and a vocalized demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis of the programming environment.

_Note: For instructions on how to access and use Panopto, use the "Panopto How-To Videos" web link provided below. To access Panopto's website, navigate to the web link titled "Panopto Access," and then choose to log in using the “WGU” option. If prompted, log in using your WGU student portal credentials, and then it will forward you to Panopto’s website._

_To submit your recording, upload it to the Panopto drop box titled “Data Cleaning NUM3 | D206 (Student Creators) [assignments].” Once the recording has been uploaded and processed in Panopto's system, retrieve the URL of the recording from Panopto and copy and paste it into the Links option. Upload the remaining task requirements using the Attachments option._

G.  Acknowledge web sources, using in-text citations and references, for segments of third-party code used to support the application. Be sure the web sources are reliable.

H.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

I.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
