## D213: Advanced Data Analysis within Python

### Course Summary

This course provides students with the skills and knowledge they need to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-changing field of data analysis. Topics covered include:

* Neutral networks: How to build and train neural networks to solve complex problems
* Randomness: How to use randomness to improve the accuracy of your models
* Unconventional data sources: How to collect and analyze data from non-traditional sources
In addition to technical skills, this course also teaches students how to think critically and creatively about data. By the end of the course, students will be able to:
* Identify and solve data analysis problems
* Communicate the results of their analyses to stakeholders
* Stay up-to-date on the latest trends in data analysis

### Objectives

- Time Series Analysis: Application of time series model in generating forecasts.
- Neural Networks: Building neural networks in the context of machine learning modeling.
- Natural Language Processing: Extraction of insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural language processing (NLP) models.

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has two assessments. Each assessment contains a written report and the Python code within the Jupyter Notebook environment.

#### Task 1
This project requires the use of the provided dataset to develop a research question that can be answered through  ARIMA time series modeling techniques. The project must include generated time series visualizations and evaluation of the stationarity within the series. Trends and seasonality must be evaluated, and a forecast provided.

My research question for this project was *“Can the telecommunication company's daily revenue be accurately forecasted in comparison to the actual observed daily revenue?”*.  I utilized twenty months of daily data to forecast four months of daily data. This provided a daily comparison of revenue to the actual observed values. 

The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D213/AFCodeD213Tk1.pdf). The Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D213/AFCodeD213Tk1.ipynb).

#### Task 2
This project encompassed the use of an authorized dataset called Labelled Sentences and Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing(NLP) to answer a developed research question. The data analysis included the use of exploratory data analysis, various data cleaning, and machine learning within a neural network. The effectiveness of the model was then evaluated.

My research question for this project was *“Can neural networks and NLP techniques be used to accurately predict a consumer’s sentiment based on written historical reviews?”*. This was based on the noted dataset called Labelled Sentences which provides historical reviews from Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB. I used a neural network to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to predict if the user would recommend or not recommend an item, restaurant, or film with the use of NLP techniques. Handling this data did have some challenges due to spelling errors, foreign characters, and emojis. The Tensorflow model generated parameters using the Embedding layer, a Flatten Layer, and a Dense node toward the final sigmoid activation function with an accuracy rate of over 80%.

 The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D213/AFCodeD213Tk2.pdf) and the Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D213/AFCodeD213Tk2.ipynb).
