### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has one assessment in the form of a written report along with an interactive Tableau Dashboard.

The project consisted of creating an interactive dashboard within Tableau based on organizational needs. The datasets utilized within this project were the WGU-provided telecommunication dataset as well as an external dataset, the [IBM telco](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telcocustomer-churn-ibm-dataset?resource=download) dataset retrieved from Kaggle. These two datasets were used to show a comparison between the two fictitious companies. Data cleaning and exploration were completed within Python and the cleaned dataset was exported to CSV to be imported into Tableau.

The project writeup can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D210/D210Task1.pdf) and the Tableau dashboard can be found on my Tableau Public page under the name, [WGUvsIBM-D210Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexa.fisher/viz/WGUvsIBM-D210Dashboard/WGUvsIBM)
