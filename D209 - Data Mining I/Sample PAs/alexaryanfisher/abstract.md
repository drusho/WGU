## D209: Data Mining within Python

###bCourse Summary
This course that expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners will implement supervised models, specifically classification and prediction data mining models, to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course also provides frameworks for assessing models' sensitivity and specificity.

The course covers the following topics:

- Supervised learning
- Classification models
- Prediction models
- Non-linear regression
- Sensitivity and specificity
- Model evaluation

### Objectives

- Classification Data Mining Models: Application of observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
- Predictive Data Mining Models: Implementation of prediction via data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
- Data Mining Model Performance: Evaluation of data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has two assessments. Each assessment contains a written report with a video presentation as well as a file containing Python code within the Jupyter Notebook environment. 

#### Task 1
The project consisted of the development of a research question using the WGU-provided telecommunication churn dataset and classification analysis model. The classification analysis had to be performed with the use of either k-nearest neighbor(KNN) or Naïve-Bayes. Students identified a set of variables and utilized `train_test_split` to obtain training and test sets before performing the classification analysis.

My research question for this project was *“Can the customer’s churn likelihood be predicted via the K-nearest neighbor method to provide the telecommunication stakeholders with focused retention areas?”*.  Unfortunately, my project including the written report and Jupyter Notebook were lost and unrecoverable to include in this Portfolio. 

#### Task 2
The project consisted of the development of a research question using the Churn dataset and an advanced regression analysis such as decision trees, random forests, and/or lasso or ridge regression. Before any analysis was completed, the dataset was again split into training and test sets prior to performing their classification analysis.

My research question for this project was, *“Is it possible to predict a customer’s tenure using the Decision Tree method and pinpoint the contributing variables for the telecommunication stakeholders?”*.  The feature selection was computed with the use of `SelectKBest` and the generated model was able to adequately forecast based on tuned hyperparameters.
