## D212: Data Mining II within Python

### Course Summary

This course builds on the data analytics skill sets to incorporate unsupervised models. Students will learn about the different types of unsupervised models, how to use them, and when they are appropriate for different organizational needs.

The course covers the following topics:

- Introduction to unsupervised learning
- Types of unsupervised models
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Association rule mining
- Anomaly detection
- Model evaluation

### Objectives

- Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques: Application of clustering techniques to accurately predict insightful outcomes.
- Principal Component Analysis: Implementation of dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.
- Market Basket Analysis: Predictions of patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has three assessments. Each assessment contains a written report as well as a file containing Python code within the Jupyter Notebook environment.  Task 1 and 3 required the video presentations that have been redacted from the reports.

#### Task 1
The project required the use of a clustering method, K-means, or Hierarchical clustering on the selected WGU-provided datasets. For this project, the Hierarchical clustering technique on the telecommunication dataset was utilized. The clustering model was generated to facilitate analysis. The results were communicated, and the model was evaluated.

My research question for this project was *“Are there any meaningful groupings provided by an analysis of the customer survey responses?*.  I analyzed the survey questionnaire of the telecommunication data set to see if there were any distinct clusters within the responses.

The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/D212Task1.pdf). The Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/AFD212Tk1.ipynb).

#### Task 2
The project required the development of a research question based on the provided dataset and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. The analysis included the number of principal components and the variance of each component prior to addressing the research question.

The research thesis for this project was *”Can the key attributes of the telecommunication company’s customers be identified using PCA?”*. The PCA was able to identify 6 key attributes after the reduction.

 The report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/D212Task2.pdf) and the Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/AFD212Tk2.ipynb).

#### Task 3
The project required the development and results of a research question with the use of a new dataset and Market Basket Analysis technique.

My research question for this project was *”What items are associated with the purchase of an Apple pencil?”* We were examining what electronic items were also purchased and used by customers alongside Apple Pencils. I am a robust Apple user so I thought it would be interesting to see what the various results were generated within my association rules.

 The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/D212Task3.pdf) and the Python Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D212/AFD212Tk3.ipynb).
