## D207: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) within Python

### Course Summary
This course teaches students how to use Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a process of inspecting data sets to summarize their master characteristics, often with visual methods. It helps to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and understand the underlying structure of the data.

The course covers the following topics:

* Importing data into Python
* Exploring data using Pandas and Matplotlib
* Visualizing data using various plots and charts
* Computing descriptive statistics
* Hypothesis testing
* arametric tests
* Communicating findings to stakeholders

### Objectives

- Data Interpretation: Interpretation of central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
- Conducting Parametric Testing: Computation of parametric testing.

### Assessments and Deliverables

The course has one assessment in the form of a written report and a video presentation. The assessment is based on a project that requires students to use Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment to import an external .csv file, analyze the data using hypothesis testing, and generate statistical visualizations.

The written report should describe the project in detail, including the steps taken to import the .csv file, analyze the data, and generate the visualizations. 

The assessment is designed to assess students' ability to:

- Import data into a Jupyter Notebook environment
- Use hypothesis testing to analyze data
- Generate statistical visualizations

The specific techniques that students use to test the hypothesis will depend on the research thesis. However, the required techniques included chi-square, t-test, or ANOVA.

My research question for this project was *“Is there an association between the contract terms and the customers who left within the last month?”*. I decided to utilize various functions and Python libraries/packages to perform the Chi-Squared Test for Independence to check if contract terms had any association with churn status. My results noted an association between the two.
