## D208: Predictive Modeling within Python

### Course Summary

This course teaches students how to use Python to prepare data for analysis, conduct logistic regression and multiple regression modeling, and make assertions based on organizational needs.

The course covers the following topics:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Logistic regression
- Multiple regression
- Normality
- Homoscedasticity
- Significance


### Objectives

- Logistic Regression: Conducting logistic regression algorithms in describing phenomena.
- Multiple Regression: Employing multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing phenomena.
- Regression Implications: Making assertions based on regression modeling.

### Assessments and Deliverables

This course has two assessments. Each assessment contains a written report with a video presentation as well as a file containing Python code within the Jupyter Notebook environment. 

#### Task 1
The project consisted of the development of a research question using the WGU-provided telecommunication churn dataset and multiple regression model. The multiple regression model included the initial model as well as a reduced model by selecting variables based on statistical justification and model evaluation metrics. Various univariate and bivariate visualizations were also included.

My research question for this project was *“ What variables contribute to the spread of Monthly Charges?”*. The use of quantitative data for the multiple regression was necessary, so I focused on the Monthly Charges and examined how the other variables within the dataset influenced this. 

The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D208/D208Task1.pdf) and the Python Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D208/AFD208CodeTk1.ipynb).

#### Task 2
The project consisted of the development of a research question using the Churn dataset and logistic regression model. The logistic regression model included the initial model as well as a reduced model by selecting variables based on statistical justification and model evaluation metrics. Various univariate and bivariate visualizations were also included.

My research question for this project was *“What variables contribute to the probability of Churn?”*.  The initial model was deemed to be statistically significant due to the z-statistic and LLR p-values found within the regression summary. Lastly, the model was deemed practically significant for the specified stakeholders.

The written report can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D208/D208Task2.pdf) and the Python Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/alexaryanfisher/Portfolio_WGU/blob/master/D208/AFD208CodeTask2.ipynb).
